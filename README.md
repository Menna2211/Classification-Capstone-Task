# Dataset
The project uses a dataset that includes clinical features of patients, which are typically available in public repositories like the Kaggle. The dataset may include the following features:
Age: Age of the patient.
Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = Male, 0 = Female).
Resting Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure measured during a medical exam.
Cholesterol Levels: Serum cholesterol levels in mg/dl.
Heart Rate: Maximum heart rate achieved during a stress test.
Exercise-Induced Angina: Presence of chest pain triggered by exercise (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
Ejection Fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart each time it contracts.
Platelets: Platelet count in the blood.
Diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
Smoking History: Whether the patient has a history of smoking (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
Target: Indicates if heart failure occurred (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

# Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions, correlations, and data imbalances.
Preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing continuous features, encoding categorical features, and addressing class imbalances
Build and evaluate the performance of various classification models, including:
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest, AdaBoost , Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
Compare the performance of models using metrics like:
Accuracy, Precision , Recall and F1-Score

# Applications
Early Diagnosis: Helps medical professionals identify at-risk patients and provide preventive care.
Patient Education: Provides patients with insights into their health risks, encouraging lifestyle changes and adherence to treatment plans.
